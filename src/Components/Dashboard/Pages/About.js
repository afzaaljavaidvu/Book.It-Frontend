        <p>Book.it aims to enhance book loversâ€™ experience in browsing for books by allowing them to add recommended books themselves! This caters to a bookwormâ€™s desire of finding and suggesting underrated books independently. The books they add will be shown to the public eye, no judgment whatsoever, which is just what we need. 
And, just remember, thereâ€™s no such thing as too many books! We, at Book.it, highly encourage you to add as many books as you like. Weâ€™d love to know what stories we havenâ€™t read yet either ðŸ˜‰</p>
